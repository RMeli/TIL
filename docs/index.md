# Rocco Meli's TIL

Today I Learned: this is a collection of things I've learned in my day-to-day work.
It's a mix of code snippets, tricks, and tips that I've picked up over the years.
Some might be ovious, but they are here as a quick reference. 
Others might be less obvious and more interesting.
